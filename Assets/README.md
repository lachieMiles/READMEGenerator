# README Generator
  
  ## Description
  By applying the knowledge from week 7 of our bootcamp, the user can use Nodejs to generate a README file, and save to their repository. When the user runs 'node index.js', they will be presented with a series of prompts, including: 'Title', 'Description', 'Installation', 'Usage', Licence', 'Contributors', Tests', and 'Questions'
